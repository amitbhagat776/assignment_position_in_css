<!-- 
    z-index is a CSS property that controls the stacking order of positioned elements (i.e., elements with position: relative, position: absolute, or position: fixed) on a web page. 
    It determines which element appears on top when multiple elements overlap.
    The z-index property accepts an integer value, where a higher value brings an element closer to the top of the stacking order.
    Elements with a higher z-index value will overlap elements with lower values. If two elements have the same z-index, the one that comes later in the HTML source order will appear on top.
